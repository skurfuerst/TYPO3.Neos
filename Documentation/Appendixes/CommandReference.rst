Neos Command Reference
======================

.. note:

  This reference uses ``./flow`` as the command to invoke. If you are on
  Windows, this will probably not work, there you need to use ``flow.bat``
  instead.

The commands in this reference are shown with their full command identifiers.
On your system you can use shorter identifiers, whose availability depends
on the commands available in total (to avoid overlap the shortest possible
identifier is determined during runtime).

To see the shortest possible identifiers on your system as well as further
commands that may be available, use::

  ./flow help
