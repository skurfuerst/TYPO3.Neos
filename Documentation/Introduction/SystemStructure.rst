Neos is made up of packages and based on the Flow framework. Some of the packages
are part of the Flow base system, Neos consists of additional packages, like
Neos and TypoScript, in which the actual CMS functionality is contained. The templates,
graphics and content of the demo site are in another package. Generally, all static website
resources (including templates, TypoScript and Images) can be found in separate packages for
each website.
